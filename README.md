This is movie website project made on mvc. 

This project uses:
1) asp.net core identity for authorization and authentication.
2) recovering a forgotten password using the user's email.
3) Interaction with the database.
4) Functions of adding to favorites and "watch later".
5) Website navigation and content searches by filters.
6) Custom video player for video content
